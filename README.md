### You can do magic!

This mod allows you to unlock a random potion effects, you can apply on yourself or a nearby mob every time you want!

## Getting Started

Search for a jungle temple (editable in the config). Once you found it, swin in water next to the temple (distance editable in the config).
You'll know that it worked, once you get blindness and confusion.
Now, you've got a random potion-ability, which you can use by pressing 'R'.
If you look at an entity while pressing the key, the effects will be aplied to the entity, otherwise to you.
On the left-down corner, you'll see a potion. Once it disappeared, you can re-use your potion-ability.

### Changes if the woodwalkers-mod is installed

If my [woodwalkers-mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/woodwalkers) is found, you're only able to unlock a potion-ability, if you're shaped as a normal player but still enabled an entity as second Shape, that also applies for using potion-abilities. Furthermore, If you're shape-ability is on cooldown, you can't use your potion-ability and vice versa.
